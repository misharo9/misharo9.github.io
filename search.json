It tries to answer the following question :\n\nWhat is computation?\nWhat are the problems suitable for computers to solve? Why are some problems impossible for computers to solve?\nWhat is the mysterious connection between complexity theory and cryptography?\n\nIn this series of blogs, I will introduce some basic concepts and fun facts in TCS, and hopefully you will be guided through the intellectual landscape of Turing Machine, lambda-calculus, complexity theory, and cryptography.\nPrerequisitesYou should have some basic knowledge about :\n\nMathematical logic, especially about propositional calculus and ZFC.\nGraph theory.\nTuring machine.\n\nI will simply review the knowledge above when needed. But if you don’t recognize them, please first learn about Discrete Mathematics.\nThis series of blogs comes from Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science lectured by Prof. Zhengfeng Ji, Tsinghua University. If you are a student from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, I strongly recommend you to attend this course. This course may be challenging for you, but you will earn a lot after finishing it. (In fact, this course is challenging for everyone except some gifted ones.)\nI will write this in English because there are not translations commoly accepted in TCS.\nWhy Should You Know about TCS?If you are student from CS, you should care about it because logic and mathematics are the language of computer science.If not, then forget about it. This is just a reading material for recreation.\nReferenceIntroduction to Theoretical Computer Science, Zhengfeng Ji.Introduction to Computer Science, Boaz Barak.\n","tags":["TCS"]}]
